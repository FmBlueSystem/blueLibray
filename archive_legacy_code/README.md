## Notes
- All files were verified as unused in the main application before archiving
- The main application uses `main_window_clean.py` as the active UI component
- Analysis modules like `enhanced_compatibility.py` and `structural_analyzer.py` remain active
- Test files like `test_complete_flow.py` and `test_application_performance.py` remain active
